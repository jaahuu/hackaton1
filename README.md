first hackaton in our guild


1. set up NPM json server - done
2. verify NPN - done
	- json-server -w db.json
	- json-server db_gen_simp.js
3. add and use faker - done
	- use: npm install faker instead of npm install -g faker
	- json-server db_gen_fake.js
4. discusion on "what is core project and how it should look like"
5. move json-server related development into server folder
6. create client folder 
7. after some research it appears that yomen provides exaclty what we need:
	- grunt
	- bower
	- angular js
	- bootstrap
	- test framework (karma)
	- community support and tutorials
8. we created some basic project and go through tutorial to make example changes
all points 1-8 done

for next time:
1. establish minimal core project (is it exaclty what yomen gives or should we cut something)
2. work with our project to add reading server and start to page results
